# LogiPU
Logisim-powered CPU with a functional compiler.
Instructions:
- Make a .txt file (name it whatever you want)
- Write your program with the instructions listed [here](https://github.com/JLPRO26/LogiPU/blob/5304af089182f120d6a3207ee526744e05f733b0/instructions.txt)
- Run compiler.py
- Input the path to your .txt file
- A new file called "compiled.txt" will be made.
- In Logisim, go to main, then open the compiled.txt file as v2.0 raw hex into the ROM.
- Click the reset button
- Now the CPU is ready to run the program. Just enable auto propagation (or click the clock)
- Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/JLPRO26/LogiPU/blob/9da65c405939792926d45d26ee764c66070cfa7a/examples.txt)
